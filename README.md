Project 1: Odin-Recipes
This is an introduction to the foundation of HTML & CSS

Project 1 completed, the coding was very straight forward. The only 
thing I considered the hardest was getting use to the git functionality.
Since starting this project my knowledge of git has grown abit, the same goes for using the terminal instead of the Github UI. 
Im looking forward for the next project.

Created a CSS directory to separate .css files from the rest. Then linked the style.css to the index.html, so I was able to add CSS to the main page.
A little bit of google was used to achieve some styles.

CSS Foundation Assignment 2 completed, I also explored the use of media query
for the first time.
It's progress to success.
