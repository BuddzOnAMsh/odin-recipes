Project 1: Odin-Recipes
This is an introduction to the foundation of HTML & CSS

Project 1 completed, the coding was very straight forward. The only 
thing I considered the hardest was getting use to the git functionality.
Since starting this project my knowledge of git has grown abit, the same goes for using the terminal instead of the Github UI.

Im looking forward for the next project.
